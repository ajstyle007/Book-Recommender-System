# üìö Book Recommender System
- Live Web App:- https://musk12-book-recommender-system.hf.space/
In this project, I developed a Book Recommender System using a combination of popularity-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The system helps users discover books based on their reading history and interactions with books, and it also highlights the top-rated books. The model is deployed using a web application built with Streamlit and hosted on Hugging Face.

- Book Recommender: A system where users input a book title, and the app recommends 6 similar books based on collaborative filtering.
- ML/DL Books: A curated list of the best books on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Stats, and Maths.
- Info Section: Provides reasons for why you should read the books.
- Contact: Includes links to my email, LinkedIn, and Medium blog.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key visualizations performed during EDA:
- Top 20 most-rated books
- Most popular authors and publishers
- Distribution of book ratings
- User demographics (age, location)
- Year of publication trends

## üß† Recommendation System Approaches

### Popularity-Based Recommendation:
- Displays books with the highest average ratings and at least 200 votes.
- Ideal for users who want to explore highly-rated, well-known books.

### Collaborative Filtering:
- Uses user interactions (ratings) to recommend books similar to a user's favorite ones.
- Personalized recommendations based on the preferences of like-minded users.

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Application

### The web app is divided into multiple tabs:

- Home: Displays the top 50 books with the best ratings.
- Book Recommender: Recommends books based on a user-inputted title.
- ML/DL Books: A section listing Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Stats, and Math books.
- Info: Why you should read the books.
- Contact: My social media links for further inquiries or feedback.
